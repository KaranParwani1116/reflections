What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually saving in commit can be very useful. It is difficult to chose in manually
    saving commit that when to commit our project but it is quiet better than
    Google docs because Automatic commit can make more commits or take long commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  It is quiet helpful if we can commit multiple files which are interrelated in
  a single commit.
  Commit multiple files seperately is difficult especially those are interrelated.
